# MonkeyProto

### To play:
Right now the game is set up to play with 2 controllers. This was tested with PS4 controllers on windows so I can't really guarantee any other setup will work.

To build it you'll need to download [flashdevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) or [haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) and [lime](https://github.com/openfl/lime) and run `lime test [platform]` in the project directory.

### Controls:
#### PS4
- Left stick to move
- Right stick to aim
- Square to shoot poop
- Triangle to eat bananas (and refill poop meter)
- The game ends when one monkey has been pooped to death
